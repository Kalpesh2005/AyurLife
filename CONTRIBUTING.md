5. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal
3. Ensure your development environment is set up correctly

### Development Workflow

1. **Keep your fork updated**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev      # Test in development mode
   npm run build    # Ensure production build works
   npm run lint     # Check for linting errors
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** (see [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process))

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop types

### File Structure

- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place pages in `src/pages/`
- Place utilities in `src/lib/`
- Place hooks in `src/hooks/`

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Test on multiple browsers

### Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Avoid code duplication

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```

- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
